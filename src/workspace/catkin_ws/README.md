# Kalman Filter ROS Lab

This catkin workspace has an example of a Extended Kalman Filter used for pose
estimation using several packages as:
 + turtlebot_gazebo
 + robot_pose_ekf
 + turtlebot_teleop
 + odom_to_trajectory

It also has the configuration file EKFLab.rviz for RViz and a main package
with the `main.launch` that runs everything you need.
